1. Use json file instead of dbm to save state on disk. It is small
   enough to overwrite it completely each time it changes and no
   need to support cocurrent access
2. Check mtime of configuration file and reread it if it changed.
   Requires some refactoring
   (log error and continue to use old loaded configuration if new file
    contain errors. Store new timestamp to watch for further
	modifications)
